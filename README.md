## How To build üî®

Since Slick2D requires OS dependent native libraries, you cannot just export an executable -jar in order to to run the game on your system outside your IDE. At the moment, the application has no executable file. So you need to copy my source code on your IDE for launch the app.

## Toolkit üß∞

* [JDK v.1.8.0_65](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - Java Development Kit. What else can I say?

* [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org) 
 Maybe the most famous IDE for Java developers. 

* [Slick2D](https://slick.ninjacave.com/javadoc/) - An easy to use set of tools and utilites wrapped around LWJGL OpenGL bindings to make 2D Java game development easier. See the documentation for more information.
